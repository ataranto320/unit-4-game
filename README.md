Approached game by first breaking it up into sections. The description of the game, then the clickable images, and then the logic behind the math of numbers generated. Used the knowledge I had at the time, researched the internet, and with some help came to a structured solution of code that made the game run properly. Breaking down the HTML with the directions was simple. It was the javascript logic that was more challenging and required more research into how to make it function properly.

Description and Instructions:

Each crystal icon has a randomized value every new game. Starting from 0 for each crystal clicked, the crystal value will be added from the previous clicked crystal icon's value. Click the different crystal icons to match the random generated total sum number to win the game.
