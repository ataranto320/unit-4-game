Approached game by first breaking it up into sections. The description of the game, then the clickable images, and then the logic behind the math of numbers generated. Used the knowledge I had at the time, researched the internet, and with some help came to a structure solution of code that made the game run properly. Breaking down the HTML with the directions was simple. It was the javascript logic that was more challenging and required more research into how to make it function properly.
